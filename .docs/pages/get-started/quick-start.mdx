## Installation

Let's get started with `@movie-web/providers`. First lets install the package.

  ```sh npm2yarn
  npm install @movie-web/providers
  ```

## Scrape your first item

To get started with scraping on the **server**, first you have to make an instance of the providers.

<Important>
This snippet will only work on a **server**. For other environments, check out [Usage on X](/essentials/usage-on-x).
</Important>

```ts title="index.ts (server)" showLineNumbers
import { makeProviders, makeStandardFetcher, targets } from '@movie-web/providers';

// this is how the library will make http requests
const myFetcher = makeStandardFetcher(fetch);

// make an instance of the providers library
const providers = makeProviders({
  fetcher: myFetcher,

  // will be played on a native video player
  target: targets.NATIVE
})
```

Perfect. You now have an instance of the providers you can reuse everywhere.
Now let's scrape an item:

```ts title="index.ts (server)" showLineNumbers
import { ScrapeMedia, makeProviders, makeStandardFetcher, targets } from '@movie-web/providers';

const myFetcher = makeStandardFetcher(fetch);

const providers = makeProviders({
  fetcher: myFetcher,
  target: targets.NATIVE
});

const media: ScrapeMedia = {
  type: 'movie',
  title: "Oppenheimer",
  releaseYear: 2023,
  tmdbId: "872585"
};
  
async function fetchData() {
  try {
    const output = await providers.runAll({
      media: media,
    });
    console.log("Output:",output)
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error occurred:', error);
  }
}

fetchData();
```

Now we have our stream in the output variable. (If the output is `null` then nothing could be found.)
