# Flags

Flags is the primary way the library separates entities between different environments.
For example, some sources only give back content that has the CORS headers set to allow anyone, so that source gets the flag `CORS_ALLOWED`. Now if you set your target to `BROWSER`, sources without that flag won't even get listed.

This concept is applied in multiple away across the library.

## Flag options
 - `CORS_ALLOWED`: Headers from the output streams are set to allow any origin.
 - `IP_LOCKED`: The streams are locked by IP: requester and watcher must be the same.
