# Introduction

## What is `@movie-web/providers`?

`@movie-web/providers` is the soul of [movie-web](https://github.com/movie-web/movie-web). It's a collection of scrapers of various streaming sites. It extracts the raw streams from those sites, so you can watch them without any extra fluff from the original sites.

## What can I use this on?

We support many different environments, here are a few examples:
 - In browser, watch streams without needing a server to scrape (does need a proxy)
 - In a native app, scrape in the app itself
 - In a backend server, scrape on the server and give the streams to the client to watch.

To find out how to configure the library for your environment, You can read [How to use on X](../2.essentials/0.usage-on-x.md).
