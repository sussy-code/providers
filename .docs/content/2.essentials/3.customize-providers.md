# Customize providers

You make the provider controls in two ways. Either with `makeProviders()` (the simpler option) or with `buildProviders()` (more elaborate and extensive option).

## `makeProviders()` (simple)

To know what to set the configuration to, you can read [How to use on X](./0.usage-on-x.md) for a detailed guide on how to configure your controls.

```ts
const providers = makeProviders({
  // fetcher, every web request gets called through here
  fetcher: makeStandardFetcher(fetch),
  
  // proxied fetcher, if the scraper needs to access a CORS proxy. this fetcher will be called instead
  // of the normal fetcher. Defaults to the normal fetcher.
  proxiedFetcher: undefined;

  // target of where the streams will be used
  target: targets.NATIVE;

  // Set this to true, if the requests will have the same IP as
  // the device that the stream will be played on.
  consistentIpForRequests: false;
})

```

## `buildProviders()` (advanced)

To know what to set the configuration to, you can read [How to use on X](./0.usage-on-x.md) for a detailed guide on how to configure your controls.

### Standard setup

```ts
const providers = buildProviders()
  .setTarget(targets.NATIVE) // target of where the streams will be used
  .setFetcher(makeStandardFetcher(fetch)) // fetcher, every web request gets called through here
  .addBuiltinProviders() // add all builtin providers, if this is not called, no providers will be added to the controls
  .build();
```

### Adding only select few providers

Not all providers are great quality, so you can make an instance of the controls with only the providers you want.

```ts
const providers = buildProviders()
  .setTarget(targets.NATIVE) // target of where the streams will be used
  .setFetcher(makeStandardFetcher(fetch)) // fetcher, every web request gets called through here
  .addSource('showbox') // only add showbox source
  .addEmbed('febbox-hls') // add febbox-hls embed, which is returned by showbox
  .build();
```


### Adding your own scrapers to the providers

If you have your own scraper and still want to use the nice utilities of the provider library or just want to add on to the built-in providers, you can add your own custom source.

```ts
const providers = buildProviders()
  .setTarget(targets.NATIVE) // target of where the streams will be used
  .setFetcher(makeStandardFetcher(fetch)) // fetcher, every web request gets called through here
  .addSource({ // add your own source
    id: 'my-scraper',
    name: 'My scraper',
    rank: 800,
    flags: [],
    scrapeMovie(ctx) {
      throw new Error('Not implemented');
    }
  })
  .build();
```
