# How to use on X

The library can run in many environments, so it can be tricky to figure out how to set it up.

Here is a checklist. For more specific environments, keep reading below:
 - When requests are very restricted (like browser client-side). Configure a proxied fetcher.
 - When your requests come from the same device on which it will be streamed (not compatible with proxied fetcher). Set `consistentIpForRequests: true`.
 - To set a target. Consult [Targets](./1.targets.md).

To make use of the examples below, check out the following pages:
 - [Quick start](../1.get-started/1.quick-start.md)
 - [Using streams](../2.essentials/4.using-streams.md)

## NodeJs server
```ts
import { makeProviders, makeStandardFetcher, targets } from '@movie-web/providers';

const providers = makeProviders({
  fetcher: makeStandardFetcher(fetch),
  target: chooseYourself, // check out https://movie-web.github.io/providers/essentials/targets
})
```

## Browser client-side

Using the provider package client-side requires a hosted version of simple-proxy.
Read more [about proxy fetchers](./2.fetchers.md#using-fetchers-on-the-browser).

```ts
import { makeProviders, makeStandardFetcher, targets } from '@movie-web/providers';

const proxyUrl = "https://your.proxy.workers.dev/";

const providers = makeProviders({
  fetcher: makeStandardFetcher(fetch),
  proxiedFetcher: makeSimpleProxyFetcher(proxyUrl, fetch),
  target: target.BROWSER,
})
```

## React native
To use the library in a react native app, you would also need a couple of polyfills to polyfill crypto and base64.

1. First install the polyfills:
```bash
npm install @react-native-anywhere/polyfill-base64 react-native-quick-crypto
```

2. Add the polyfills to your app:
```ts
// Import in your entry file
import '@react-native-anywhere/polyfill-base64';
```

And follow the [react-native-quick-crypto documentation](https://github.com/margelo/react-native-quick-crypto) to set up the crypto polyfill.

3. Then you can use the library like this:

```ts
import { makeProviders, makeStandardFetcher, targets } from '@movie-web/providers';

const providers = makeProviders({
  fetcher: makeStandardFetcher(fetch),
  target: target.NATIVE,
  consistentIpForRequests: true,
})
```
