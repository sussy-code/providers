# Targets

When creating provider controls, you will immediately be required to choose a target.

::alert{type="warning"}
A target is the device on which the stream will be played.
**Where the scraping is run has nothing to do with the target**, only where the stream is finally played in the end is significant in choosing a target.

#### Possible targets
- **`targets.BROWSER`** Stream will be played in a browser with CORS
- **`targets.BROWSER_EXTENSION`** Stream will be played in a browser using the movie-web extension (WIP)
- **`targets.NATIVE`** Stream will be played on a native video player
- **`targets.ANY`** No restrictions for selecting streams, will just give all of them
